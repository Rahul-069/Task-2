# Task-2

Myself S Rahul, student of CSE department.

While performing the tasks i have learnt things which are very new and interesting and awesome as well.

First of all I learnt the basics of linux from "The Construct" site. Since it also has a virtual machine which will give us a practical knowledge, it helped me understand better on the concepts. And mainly me performing the tasks alongside was more fascinating and that thing always kept the eagerness of reading and learning it and not letting down the enthusiasm.There i learnt about bash scripts and some points about it on internet as well and then i started writing bash scripts.
I learnt many things like different commands used on linux, extensions , files, etc.
Shell scripting was also learnt
Even got to know the different functions that can be used for generating passwords of different lengths.There are many functions that can create a password of a given length out of which i have representated two of it.

One new thing I learnt is reading file from a C code or anything (linux,python,etc) that i never expected.That may make are tasks easier when compared to giving inputs one by one.

I also learnt that a robot workspace can be representated as a 2D matrix.

And finally the thing or work I most loved while doing it is accessing a photo and then bringing changes to it like printing it in a black and white format, print its percentage pixels etc. and then representating it in different colors which is just amazing.

And at last i learnt what is Git and GitHub, it's uses and its different functions like creating, pushing, cloning, etc.
